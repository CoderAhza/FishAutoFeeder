# üê† Fish Auto Feeder with AI & Camera Detection

# Project Overview
This project started from a desire to help aquarium owners take better care of their fish with less effort. We know that keeping fish happy and healthy can be tough. It involves keeping an eye on water conditions and feeding them on time. To make this easier, we built a smart system that uses AI and internet technology to automate these tasks.

With our solution, you get real-time information and automatic control over your aquarium. This means you no longer have to worry about feeding schedules or manually checking on your fish all the time. Our goal is to improve the aquarium experience, making it more fun and less work for fish owners. We want to set new standards for how people care for their aquariums by using advanced technology.
